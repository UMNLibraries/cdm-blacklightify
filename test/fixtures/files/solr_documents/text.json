  "collection_description_tesi": "A growing collection of domestic receipt books dating from the 17th through the 19th century. Often written by the mother of the house, they were used to care for family and sometimes livestock. Some of the receipts are written by physicians for the pharmacist to fill, but most consist of components that were readily available in local fields or the apothecaryâ€™s shop.",
