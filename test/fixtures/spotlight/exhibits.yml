  title: Medical Receipt Books
  slug: exhibit-2
  description: A growing collection of domestic receipt books dating from the 17th
    through the 19th century. Often written by the mother of the house, they were
    used to care for family and sometimes livestock. Some of the receipts are written
    by physicians for the pharmacist to fill, but most consist of components that
    were readily available in local fields or the apothecaryâ€™s shop.
