    # A viewer is a single thing that is comprised of one or more assets.
    # Naming conventions and class model could be a *lot* better here.
    #
    # Each asset knows what kind of viewer it belongs to. So, once we have
    # a list of assets (see grouped_assets below), grab the first asset,
    # instantiate its viewer, and convert the list of assets to a viewer

    #
    # Compound items can have different kinds of children - videos, images, etc
    # React Borealis expects to get a json object brokent down into these
    # different kinds of things. e.g.:
    # {
    #   "image" => {type"=>"image", "tileSources"=>["info?id=p1...
    #   "kaltura_video" => {"type"=>"kaltura_video", "targetId"=>"blah"...
